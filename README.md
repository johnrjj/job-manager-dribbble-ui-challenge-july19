### Dribble UI Challenge - July 2019

-------- 

## Bonus Update: Watch the 2 Minute Timelapse Video

Since I get so many questions about my workflow, I decided to record a timelapse of me attempting the challenge. The video takes 4 hours and 11 minutes of coding and timelapses it into 2 minutes. Hold on tight (There's a longer video at the bottom of the README if this one is too fast for you).

In the video, I go from a single screenshot and create-react-app (read: from nothing!) to an initial component-based implementation in React in under five hours.

## Overview

Every now and then I like to flex my CSS muscles; One of my honed skills is being able to rapidly prototype web pages from scratch -- in this case, just a screenshot.

##### What's the Dribbble UI challenge?

Pick a top web design on Dribbble and implement the UI using React as fast as possible. Best time wins!

#### What's this month's Dribbble of choice?

[Dashboard - Job Manager](https://dribbble.com/shots/6696668-Dashboard-Job-Manager)

It is one of the highest viewed web designs of this month on Dribbble.

#### Why do this?

One of my hobbies is taking a random screenshot from dribbble and seeing how fast I can implement the UI with React and styled-components.

## 10 Minute Timelapse Extended Blu-Ray Edition 

If the 2 minute timelapse is too quick, and you want a more detailed video, here is the 10 minute version which I think can be followed a bit better.

## FAQ

#### Tools used

My tools of choice are Sketch, React, styled-components and react-feathers. 

#### Can I hire you?

Feel to inquire about my hourly rate or larger project estimates. Give me a Sketch file and I'll give you a quality web application.

#### How did you get good at this?

Practice. Lots of practice.
